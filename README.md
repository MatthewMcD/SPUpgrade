# SPUpgrade and Farm Audit
SharePoint 2016 Upgrade Resources (upgrading from SharePoint 2013 to SharePoint 2016)
These are my Farm Audit files from my workshop course and Pluralsight course on upgrading from SharePoint 2013 to SharePoint 2016.

## The Articles
I have created a series of articles on the topic of Auditing and Upgrading a SharePoint 2013 farm to SharePoint 2016. You can begin your read here http://ableblue.com/blog.

## The Pluralsight Course
The course is presented on Pluralsight.com. Once released the trailer video will be here.

## The Workshop
I am doing an upgrade workshop at [Unity Connect 2016] (https://www.unityconnect.com/2016).
I'll also present the workshop in Orlando for [SharePoint Live! 360] (https://splive360.com/ECG/live360events/Events/Orlando-2016/Information/Sharepoint-Live.aspx)
